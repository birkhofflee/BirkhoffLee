### Ciao! Mi chiamo Alex.&nbsp;&nbsp;👋

I'm Alex, aka birkhoff on the Internet. I'm a software designer who's been building software for over 10 years, including ones that millions of people use daily. I also build secure and repeatable hybrid cloud infrastructure.

- 🔨 My favourite languages are TypeScript and Python 3.
- 🌱 I've been actively [contributing to open source since 2013](https://github.com/BirkhoffLee).
- ⚡ Besides software engineering, I'm into LLMs and blockchains as well.
- 💬 I speak Mandarin Chinese, English and Italian.
